Virtual bar based on the principals of Brewski's Tavern.
<br><br>

In April 2010, my brother and I opened a bar called Brewski's Tavern in Greensboro, NC. Despite making many mistakes along the way, the bar was subjectively very successful. We ran the bar for 3 years, but decided not to renew our lease due to disagreements with the landlord. We briefly attempted to search for a new location, but ultimately the bar never reopened. Currently the well loved bar is greatly missed by many.

For those of you who are sad about this news, I just want to say 'don't be'. Brewski's is not dead, it's just relocating. Brewski's will return bigger (or smaller) and better than ever. Yes, there will be some downtime, but I personally am looking at that as a well earned vacation in which I will marry the love of my life.
<br>
Brewski's is a bar, which means it is a social setting, which means that it's defined by its people, its customers and employees, not by its walls or its physical address. If you loved Brewski's because you could walk to it, then yes, it's changing. If you loved Brewski's for any of a thousand other reasons, then enjoy the fact that we're not gonna let something like a lease dispute stop us from having our bar.
<br>
And for those of you who want to credit me with making Brewski's the bar it is today. I just want to say that I only did about 10% of the work. You did the rest. I can invite you to 'Halfway New Year' and put up decorations. But it's the people that show up that make the night truly special. I'm just glad I had a front row seat.
<br>
Thank everyone for an amazing last three years, and I look forward to seeing you at Brewski's II.

Over 5 years after that post, there is still no "Brewski's II", but we still own brewskistavern.com. As a web developer, I don't see why we need a physical location or liquor license to enjoy an adult beverage with a friend. We can utilize video chat technology to have a real beer in a virtual bar.
